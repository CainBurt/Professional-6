## standard tasks

`gulp` Will run and then watch sass, js, and images tasks.

`gulp package` will product a package in the directory above that contains
whitelisted files. This is used to generate a 'package' version of the theme
that can be deployed to developement environments.

If you've made any changes to `gulpfile.js`, or added some new sas or js paths, then you'll need to restart the `gulp` task.

#### NPM scripts

Npm scripts are also setup, if you want to use them.

`npm start` basically just runs `gulp` (the standard dev / watch task).

`npm run build` runs `gulp package`.

### Flags

`--production` will run tasks configured to output for production. This often
means output files will be compressed.

`gulp package --production` will run the packaging task while also compressing
outputted files. The generated package should be deployed to development
environments and live environments.

`--pipeline` is for use only if the task is being run from a pipeline. All this does is change the name of the packaged folder to 'pipeline' so that bitbucket can save it as an artifact for automated deployment.

## File and folder structure

### `functions.php`

The engine room of any WordPress install. This is where Timber is initialised, and any modifications to the default WordPress behaviour are made.

We also use hooks to include any extras, like new Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, ACF Options Pages, and Page Blocks.

#### `includes/`

If you've got a lot of things added in `functions.php`, you might want to split it off into a separate file. Use the `includes` folder to add new .php files and then use `require_once` in `functions.php` to include them.

### `templates/` and `components/`

In these folders we put our `.twig` templates. The `templates` folder is best used for page and post templates. Basically anything that receives data directly from a .php template like `single.php` or `page.php`.

The `components` folder is where reusable element templates are. Things like `image.twig` or `menu.twig` that get passed data and can be used anywhere in the site. You might also want to save your block templates here too.

### `src/`

This is where all our raw static assets are saved for development. Use `gulp` to generate built files from `js` or `sass` which get saved in `dist`, ready to use in the browser.
There are also tasks set up for `images` and `fonts` folders within `src` that minify and serve image and font files into `dist`.

### Extra Directories

You might want to create or include many extra directories in the theme - that's great!
But remember to add anything you'll need in your packaged theme into the `packageWhitelist` constant in `gulpfile.js`, otherwise it'll be ignored in the build process.
